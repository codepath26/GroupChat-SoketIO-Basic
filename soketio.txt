to make the npm init defult just put -y 

1)
npm i soket.io 

npm i nanoid // this is use for the frontend part broalso useinto the react bro
nanoid is use to create the random id for the user which are use into the webdevlopment // 
Import the nanoid function from the nanoid package

import { nanoid } from 'nanoid';

// Generate a new unique ID

const uniqueId = nanoid()   // By default, it generates a 21-character ID
console.log(uniqueId);



2)
connect to the server
const io = require('soket.io')(3000);
io.on('connection',(socket)=>{
socket.on('disconnect' ,()=>{

})
} )

// now comes into  the front end part bro
first add the socket cdn to html 
<!-- Include Socket.io library -->
<script src="https://cdn.socket.io/4.1.3/socket.io.js"></script>
make js file


3)  what is the differance between the create server and the Server method into the http?
ans_
 createserver basically use to create normal server but in case of the server() method it's provide some more control and functionallity and costumisation you need over your server.

 4)


 client side socketio
 add the cdn file to html and initialize with const socket= io();
 catch the evente and fired the event it's easy method




how to  create your own event from server side and client side and catch from the other side
server side ==> client side catch
client side ==> server side catch
in this both case we have to use the io.emit and io.on 

Broadcasting -it's use to send the message to all user are connected

1)user can seee how many users are connected
2) if user connected then we wil show a welcome messafe to user and users can see how many users connected


when we use soket.emit and io.socket.emit bro what is the differance?
So, in summary:

socket.emit is used on the client-side to send data or trigger events to the server.
io.sockets.emit is used on the server-side to send data or trigger events to all connected clients.
// Client-side code
socket.emit('chatMessage', 'Hello, server!');
// Server-side code this is use for the everyone who are connected
io.sockets.emit('serverMessage', 'Hello, clients!');




then how to pass the message to new join user welcome and another user show how many users are connected 
for the new users   socket.emit('newuserjoin' , {message : 'Welcome Buddy...'})
for other users   socket.broadcast.emit('newuserjoin',{message : `${usrs} users joinned`})
this is done for the connection now comes into the disconnet user
for other users   socket.broadcast.emit('newuserjoin',{message : `${usrs} users joinned`})


5)what is namespace why weare user and how to create or use Namesapces;

makke the variablue by using the io.of event

const cnsp = io.of('/customenamespace') 
now use the cnsp where you use io like
io.on ==> cnsp.on for the special namespace just we are created




6)what is room in the socket io?
ans =>
how to create the room?
first create the namespace and with the help of that just create connection to namespace
const cnsp = io.of('/rooms);
const roomno = 1;
cnsp.on('connection' , (socket)=>{
socket.join(`room-${1}`);
cnsp.sockets.in(`room-${1}`).emit('connectionroom' , 'you are in the room-1');
})
